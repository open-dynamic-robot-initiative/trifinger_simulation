robot_interfaces with Simulation
================================

It is possible to use ``robot_interfaces`` with pyBullet by using the pyBullet
driver in the backend.  By doing this, you only need to replace the backend when
switching between simulation and real robot while all the rest of your code can
remain the same.


To create a TriFinger backend using simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    import trifinger_simulation.drivers

    backend = trifinger_simulation.drivers.create_trifinger_backend(
        robot_data, real_time_mode=True, visualize=True
    )

If ``real_time_mode`` is ``True``, the backend will expect a new action every
millisecond and repeat the previous action if it is not provided in time (like
on the real robot).  If set to ``False``, it will run as fast as possible and
wait for new actions.

Set ``visualize=True`` to run the pyBullet GUI for visualization.
